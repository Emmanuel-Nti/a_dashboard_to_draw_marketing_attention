|I work as a video ad analyst at the Sterling & Draper advertising agency. I devote a lot of time to analyzing trending videos on YouTube to determine what content deserves marketing attention. Every week, new employees Melanie and Ashok ask me the same questions on trending videos: What video categories were trending last week? How were they distributed among various regions? What categories were especially popular in the United States? I have decided that it's high time the process was automated. I am going to build a dashboard for Melanie and Ashok. | Tableau* | Practicum by Yandex |
